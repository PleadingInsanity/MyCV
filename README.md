# MyCV

This project is a website  that acts as my personal professional website. This introduces me as a professional in a more casual light. For more details about my education and work experience please see my Linkedin (link at bottom of page). For more of my projects please see my GitHub (link at bottom of page).

There are no special features to this page.

No installation is required to view the page but certain elements may not work as expected on Internet Explorer.
